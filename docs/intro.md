# Introduction

**CrossDB** is a ultra high-performance, lightweight embedded and server OLTP RDBMS. 
It is designed for high-performance scenarios where the main memory can hold the entire database.

## Use Cases

- High-frequency trading (OLTP).
- High-performance queries.
- High-performance data management: Use CrossDB OnDisk DB to store data on HDD/SSD/Flash.
- High-performance IMDB: Use CrossDB In-Memory DB to manage process runtime data, replacing STL or hand-written data structures.
- Use CrossDB RamDisk DB to support process restartability and in-service software upgrades (ISSU) easily.
- Use CrossDB as a super-fast cache DB.

<!--
- You can use CrossDB Trigger to implement Data-Driven programming paradigm.
- You can use CrossDB PUBSUB to subscribe DB from other process's DB either on same host or remote host.
- You can use CrossDB to implement Centralize-DB programming paradigm.
- You can use CrossDB eventloop to implement event-driven programming paradigm.
- You can use CrossDB RPC to build distributed service.
- You can use CrossDB CLI tool to debug running program's data in off-line way.
- You can use CrossDB SQL to view/create/update/delete/filter program data.
- You can use CrossDB Browser to view program data.
- You can use CrossDB to do DB backup restore it.
- You can use CrossDB DB Change Log to view DB change history with filter, backtrace, rate-limit, expiring, etc.
- You can use Python connector to write unit test with SQL to test program.
- You can copy the DB folders from device and open on PC/Server with CrossDB-cli or Python directly.
- Use CrossDB DB-Driven Mode to Build Program Logic (Table Trigger, FK, auto delete, Cascade Trigger)
- Use CrossDB Python Connector to do DB-Driven Unit Test
- Use CrossDB Pub/Sub to Build Distributed System (Eventloop/Timer/WorkQueue, vs IPC, OOP [priv data])
- Use CrossDB Pub/Sub to Build Centralized DB-Driven System (3rd lang, DM no checkpoint)
- CrossDB Serialization and RPC
- CrossDB SQL Connectors (RESP3, Python)
- CrossDB SQL Drivers (C, Python)
